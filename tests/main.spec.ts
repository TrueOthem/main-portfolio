/**
 * This file serves as a centralized entry point for running all test suites.
 *
 * Tests are organized by feature and device compatibility:
 * 1. Navigation - Testing all link navigation across the site
 * 2. Animation - Testing Framer Motion animations and transitions
 * 3. Responsive Design - Testing layout on different devices
 * 4. Accessibility - Testing WCAG compliance and keyboard navigation
 * 5. Forms - Testing form validation and submission
 * 6. Visual Regression - Testing UI consistency
 *
 * Each test handles:
 * - Device-specific behaviors (mobile, tablet, desktop)
 * - Animation adaptations based on device and user preferences
 * - Accessibility concerns including reduced motion
 *
 * To run all tests: npx playwright test
 * To run a specific category: npx playwright test tests/ui/
 * To run with UI: npx playwright test --ui
